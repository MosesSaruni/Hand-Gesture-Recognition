# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Hand gesture recognition project

Hand-gesture recognition software in python using OpenCV, mediapipe and tensorflow. I utilised mediapipe’s solution.hands module for hand recognition, a pre-trained model from tensorflow to recognize key points and connect them to give a hand structure overlay. By using the key points and the model, the program is able to predict and output the name of the user’s hand gesture.
